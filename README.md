### MineSweeper

Minesweeper is a game that played by one player, played by opening all the field while evading the bombs by marking them with flags and clicking the safe field. The player will click on a square in the field to open the square. The square’s contents are a bomb, a number, or a blank square.

If a player opens a square that contains a bomb, the player loses.
If the square contains a number,  the number represents how many bombs are there in the square’s current location on a 3 x 3 spaces.
If a player opens a square that contains a blank square, that is a safe zone, there is no bomb near there.

The winning conditions are when all the bombs are evaded and all other fields are opened.
